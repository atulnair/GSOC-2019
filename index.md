## Overview:

Ayanda is an Open Source Android Library that makes it easy to discover nearby devices and share files through a simple API. Ayanda is meant to detect nearby devices using WiFi and Bluetooth technology. Currently the Ayanda library uses Wifi-Direct and Bluetooth to pair to nearby enabled Android devices and send files between devices. This library can be useful for creating apps that can respond to nearby users and provide proximity based services. It also is essential in allowing for Offline communication in a situation such as the internet is censored or shutdown completely -- A mesh network can be built on this.

## Credits

First of all, this would not have been possible without the support of my mentor and friends. So a huge shout-out to my mentor Sabelo Mhlambi and to my friends.

Next, I would like to thank Google for organising such an amazing program for students who are passionate about coding and giving them an opportunity to gain some hands-on experience.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family for teaching me that itâ€™s okay to fail, to fall and hit a dead end, but never give up.
